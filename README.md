# Distributed Story Point calculator

Sprint Planning became a tedious job due to Covid-19 pandemic and our team started working from home. We were not able to use Scrum Poker to calculate Story Points. First attempt of choosing the SP was that we started writing the SP of a task on the chat box. Later we figured out that it had a terrible consequence due to seeing other's SP estimate influences one's own SP estimate. Therefore I decided to write a real time web app where it can hide one's SP estimate until the vote is finished.This app also automatically calculates the average after the vote ðŸ˜‰
