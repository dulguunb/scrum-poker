# Distributed Story Point calculator


Sprint Planning became a tedious job due Covid-19 pendamic and our team started working from home. We were not able to use Scrum Poker to calculate Story Points. First attempt of choosing the SP was that we started writing the SP of a task on the chat box. Later we figured out that it had a terrible consequence due to seeing other's SP estimate influences one's own SP estimate. Therefore we needed to hide one's SP until the scrum master tells the team to show the story point. Therefore I decided to write this distributed real time web app where it allows a team member would not get influenced by the other team members' estimates.
